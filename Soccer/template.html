    <h1>Template Pattern in Soccer</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>What is the Template Pattern?</h2>
      <p>The Template Pattern is like a recipe you follow step-by-step. Some steps always stay the same, like the bread in a sandwich. But other parts, like the filling, can change.</p>
      <p>In programming, this pattern is useful when you want to keep certain steps consistent but allow others to vary based on specific needs.</p>

      <h2>Soccer Scenario</h2>
      <p>Consider Ronaldo and Messi. Both follow a similar structure in a game: they warm up, play in their unique style, execute signature moves, and celebrate. While the warm-up and celebration are the same, their play styles and moves differ.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Template Code Example</h2>
      <pre><code class="language-java">
abstract class SoccerPlayer {

    // Template method defining the skeleton of a soccer player's game
    public final void playGame() {
        warmup();
        setPlayStyle();
        executeSignatureMove();
        celebrate();
    }

    //Both will warm up in the same manner.
    private void warmup() {
        System.out.println("Warming up with some dribbling and stretches.");
    }

    //This is where these two players behaviors will differ.
    protected abstract void setPlayStyle();
    protected abstract void executeSignatureMove();

    //Both will celebrate in the same way.
    private void celebrate() {
        System.out.println("Celebrates the victory!");
    }
}
      </code></pre>

      <pre><code class="language-java">
// Concrete class for Ronaldo's play style and signature move
class Ronaldo extends SoccerPlayer {
    @Override
    protected void setPlayStyle() {
        System.out.println("Ronaldo does his step overs.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void executeSignatureMove() {
        System.out.println("Ronaldo performs his signature 'knuckleball' free kick.");
    }
}

// Concrete class for Messi's play style and signature move
class Messi extends SoccerPlayer {
    @Override
    protected void setPlayStyle() {
        System.out.println("Messi does his body feints.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void executeSignatureMove() {
        System.out.println("Messi curls the ball in from the top of the 18-yard box.");
    }
}
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Running the Template Pattern</h2>
      <pre><code class="language-java">
public class SoccerGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SoccerPlayer ronaldo = new Ronaldo();
        SoccerPlayer messi = new Messi();

        System.out.println("Ronaldo's Game:");
        ronaldo.playGame();

        System.out.println("\nMessi's Game:");
        messi.playGame();
    }
}
      </code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Output</h2>
      <p><strong>Ronaldo's Game:</strong><br>
         Warming up with some dribbling and stretches.<br>
         Ronaldo does his step overs.<br>
         Ronaldo performs his signature 'knuckleball' free kick.<br>
         Celebrates the victory!</p>

      <p><strong>Messi's Game:</strong><br>
         Warming up with some dribbling and stretches.<br>
         Messi does his body feints.<br>
         Messi curls the ball in from the top of the 18-yard box.<br>
         Celebrates the victory!</p>

      <p>Notice that both players follow the same steps, but their play styles and signature moves differ.</p>
