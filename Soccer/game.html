      <p>This project is a work in progress, <span class="crossthrough">but the Selenium web scraper is functional. It runs in headless mode, so you won't see the Chrome browser pop up while it scrapes the data.</span></p>
      <p>AH, I had to make changes becuase when pushing this to Render, there was no way to trigger the Selenium python without having to do some weird hacky thing, so rewrote this into Go. Honestly, way better. It is way faster than python.</p>
      <p>In the future, I plan to automate the scraping process with a cron job to run daily in the morning, ensuring the soccer games are up-to-date.</p>
      <p>I'm also considering adding an AI agent that will select which games to watch based on bigger teams, matchups, or tournament prestige.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I want to include games from top-tier teams across leagues such as Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, and the Champions League matches.</p>
      <p>On the backend, Iâ€™m learning Go. I can see why people love it: simple to write, fast, and compiled. This project made me realize the speed difference in python and go. It is very noticable.</p>
