    <section>
      <p>This project is a work in progress, but the Selenium web scraper is functional. It runs in headless mode, so you won't see the Chrome browser pop up while it scrapes the data.</p>
      <p>In the future, I plan to automate the scraping process with a cron job to run daily in the morning, ensuring the soccer games are up-to-date.</p>
      <p>I'm also considering adding an AI agent that will select which games to watch based on bigger teams, matchups, or tournament prestige.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I want to include games from top-tier teams across leagues such as Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, and the Champions League matches.</p>
      <p>On the backend, Iâ€™m learning Go. I can see why people love it: simple to write, fast, and compiled.</p>
