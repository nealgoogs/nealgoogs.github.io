Comment: Reading the article it doesn't seem too bad. He said that Rodri and Vini were both very close to each other in football ability, but mainly put Rodri ahead of Vini because Rodri performed in the Euros, and Vini did not in the Copa. And the 'class and fair play' is one of the criteria of the Ballan D'or (whether it should be is a different discussion). It's not like he put Vini at 8th like other jounalists, he put him 2nd and Bellingham at 3rd.

Comment: its pretty common for footballers once they join youth teams of clubs to get fully funded education like Rodri did

also footballers legit have so much free time during their career because they're done with training by like 1 or 2pm that they have the rest of the day off so if they want to get educated in their free time, they could do

like Vincent Kompany came from a pretty disadvantaged background if you read his family history and he still took an interest in getting himself educated while he was at Ma

Comment: It‚Äôs entirely relevant. In terms of whether Vini had a stellar season it can only be judged by comparing him to other ballon d‚Äôor winners/nominees. And he didn‚Äôt have a stellar season just because he won CL POTY‚Äîit‚Äôs a minimum qualification to be considered for an award like the ballon d‚Äôor. I‚Äôm making the point that winning CL POTY doesn‚Äôt automatically mean you‚Äôve had such a stellar season that you deserve the ballon d‚Äôor.

People aren't mentioning racism *just* because he didn't win, but rather because of whats coming out about why journalists placed him where they did.

Comment: Because they did. If Rodri won it because of his performance in both club and country then Carvajal definitely deserves it. If your talking about how important Rodri and Vini were to their respective teams then Carvajal definitely does.


If your looking at stats, Vini was the best winger last season just like how Rodri was the best CDM last season just like how Dani was the best RB. 


But if your going with "oh Vini scored and assisted x, Rodri did X and Carvajal only got x" then your right Carvajal isn't

Not everything has to be an argument and "my tribe vs your tribe"mentality,  it's just a game after all and we are adults who like to watch them play.

Presuming he keeps it up, I'd argue it would be well deserved as well. Even in the Sunday game, Lewa actually made it happen for Barca, Yamal was pretty average up to that point. With Lamine I'm worried they are putting way too many minutes on him at a young age, I've seen statistics that showed putting too many minutes on young players ends up severely lowering the span of their career

Comment: It depends on which of his injured periods you look at. In the first Rodrygo wasn‚Äôt doing jackshit at LW and Bellingham carried, in the second Rodrygo entered crazy form for a month and a half and deservedly got praised for it, but then never really hit the same kind of form later in the season, similar to how Bellingham fell off slightly.

True that Messi didn't score alot in the knockout stages in 2015. What Messi did off the ball in those games is stuff that Haaland can't do. That helped already world class players in Suarez and Neymar have that output because as dangerous as they are Messi with the ball or making a run always pulled defe

Comment: I agree, everyone is bringing up Rodri's unbeaten streak, which is legit and he was a big part of that (and deserving of the award), but so many games in that streak the games were won by Haaland, KDB, etc. Rodri was far from the best midfielder, let alone player on Spain, his POTT had people saying "he was good but far from the best player". Everyone acting like he single handedly carried Spain and City to success are being disingenuous.

Comment: Is everyone just going to ignore that Vinicus played only 26 games in la liga?

It's not "barely" if we look at their stats per game, where Vinicius has pretty much double the G/A per game.


Rodri has 17 G/A in 2938min. Vinicius had 19 in 1875min.

That would be a goal or assist every 172min vs every 98mim.

And that is only in the league. The difference is bigger in all competition, where it's 173min for Rodri vs 88min for Vinicius.

OK but the WC is almost always a factor, with the only exceptions being Messi in 2010 and Ronaldo in 2014. 2022 went to the WC winner, 2018 went to the best WC player, 2006 to the winner, 2002 to the winner, 1998 to the winner, 1994 to the top scorer (the winner was not eligible in those years as it was for Europe
