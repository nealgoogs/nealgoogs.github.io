    <h1>My Opinion on Vini Jr</h1>
    <p>
      Maybe I am spoiled by the Ronaldo and Messi era. But dude, nobody really deserved the
      Ballon Dor this year. Jude Bellingham was good in first part of the year. Rodri was decent
      but I get it, not exciting. Vini was hot garbage for Brazil. Lewandowski not winning
      was a bigger robbery.
      <br><br>
      Vini Jr is also a very fucking unlikeable dude.
